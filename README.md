# Sub-Strings

## A project from <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-sub-strings">TOP Ruby Course</a>

### How it works

* it takes a word as the first argument and then an array of valid substrings (your dictionary) as the second argument.
* it returns a hash
    * listing each substring (case insensitive) that was found in the original string
	* how many times it was found
